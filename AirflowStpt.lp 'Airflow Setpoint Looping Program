CFMSetpoint:
  CoolFlowBand = MaxFlow - MinFlow
  CoolFlowStpt = MinFlow + (CoolFlowBand) * abs(TerminalLoad)
  HeatFlowBand = MaxFlowWarmup - MinFlowWarmup
  WarmupFlowStpt = MinFlowWarmup + (HeatFlowBand) * abs(TerminalLoad)
  AirflowStpt = (UnitStatus = 1) * (MinFlowHeat) + (UnitStatus = 2) * (WarmupFlowStpt) + (UnitStatus = 3) * (CoolFlowStpt)
  If UnitStatus = 15 then Goto Calibration

'Cooling Mode - airflow setpoint will be propotional to room setpoint error
'               across the cooling airflow setpoint band (low to high)
'Heating Mode - airflow setpoint will be the minimum heating flow setpoint (use reheat)
'Morning Warmup - airflow setpoint will be proportional to room setpoint error
'               across the warmup airflow setpoint band (low to high)

Calibration:
  If UnitStatus <> 15 then Goto CFMSetpoint

E:
  Goto CFMSetpoint
